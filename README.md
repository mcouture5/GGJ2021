# GGJ2021
Global Game Jam 2021 Boys

## Setup Instructions
We are using Typescript with webpack. You must have a server running to view the game, phaser does not transfer files over a file based webpage.

## 1) Checkout source
Clone the repo to your machine. `git clone https://github.com/mcouture5/GGJ2021.git`

## 2) Install dependencies
`npm install` in the main folder.

## 3) Run dev build
The dev webpack build will auto build whenever changes are made. No need to rebuild and crap.

`npm run dev`

## 4) Profit
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see the game
